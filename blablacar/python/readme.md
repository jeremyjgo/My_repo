General Observations:

During the case study, I tried to use Object Oriented Programming as much as possible,
so that it could (theoratically) be added to a more complex production environnement.

Limitations:
As the API doesn't provide a date information, the data returned is always the data available at the time of the call. Therefore there doesn't seem to be a way a getting data from last year for example, for a potential backfill, if needed.

Columns are not renamed to keep the data as it comes from the API.
