General Observations:

Documentation is provided on .yml files as if they were written in a dbt core environnement.

Limitations

The model doesn't take trip boosts into account as they are not explicitely a 'trip-offering' as listed by the drivers.
Also, I guess that trip boosts are a result of an algorithm based on the OLTP layer of the trip offering.
